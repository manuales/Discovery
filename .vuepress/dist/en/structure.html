This page offers a graphic view of all the elements present in the System (files, programs, variables) and their relationships (to and from). A complete and easy to understand image of the entire System. From here you can download any detail.</p> <p>This page also shows the structure in detail of each element, as well as the complete information of it. Depending on the type of element be can navigate between the different options that are presented. Also, in the case of file type elements, be can download all the information contained in each file, ie the records that make up that element.</p> <p>Groups and Subgroups can be defined at different depth levels, which allows identifying the functional components in the data structure.</p> <p>Subsystems can be identified, extracted and analyzed separately, to focus on their various characteristics and to follow specific data flows. Any of them can be identified and Tagged separately, including all appropriate metadata (owner, responsible, type, level of protection, etc.).</p> <p>To access this page, select the &quot;<strong>System structure</strong>&quot; option in the &quot;<strong>Options</strong>&quot; droplist of the &quot;<strong>Main Menu</strong>&quot;. Next, its appearance is shown:</p> <center><img src="/en/020.jpg" alt="" style="width:50%;"></center> <p><img src="/en/021.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>The &quot;<strong>System structure</strong>&quot; page consists of three sections where be can execute and visualize the results of the different functionalities. Below are shown:</p> <p><img src="/en/022.jpg" alt=""></p> <ul><li><strong>Display Panel</strong>. It is the central area of this section where the entire result is shown after the execution of the various functionalities offered by this page. It can be also observed information about the element or the selection of elements that will be explained later.</li> <li><strong>Left Vertical Menu</strong>. This menu contains shortcuts of the &quot;<strong>Main Menu</strong>&quot; and is also oriented to the configuration of the graph, that is, be can select from this menu the relation in which an element is related to the rest, be can also change the way in which the graph is presented, among other things that will be explained later.</li> <li><strong>Main Menu</strong>. This menu maintains all the features and functions of the &quot;<strong>Main Menu</strong>&quot; of the home page, with the difference that new droplist and menus have been added, which contain the analysis options. All will be explained later.</li></ul> <p>Next, each of the previously mentioned sections will be explained.</p> <h2 id="display-panel"><a href="#display-panel" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Display Panel</h2> <p>The &quot;<strong>Display Panel</strong>&quot; is the section where the results of the execution of the various options are shown, in this section it can be see in the upper part a &quot;<strong>Status Bar</strong>&quot; that shows information about the element or the selection of elements. It also has a hidden sub-section called &quot;<strong>Selection Panel</strong>&quot; that is displayed when be click on the icon on the right side of the &quot;<strong>Status Bar</strong>&quot;.</p> <p><img src="/en/023.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>When be proceed to select one or several elements, the &quot;<strong>Status Bar</strong>&quot; shows information that refers to the selection made. There are also two buttons that allow navigation in the structure of the selected element, showing its source code and its general information, among other things. Next, the &quot;<strong>Status Bar</strong>&quot; will be explained.</p> <h3 id="status-bar"><a href="#status-bar" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Status Bar</h3> <p><img src="/en/024.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Next, the information shown in the &quot;<strong>Status Bar</strong>&quot; is explained in detail:</p> <p><img src="/en/025.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Pressing this button displays a pop-up page with the legend of all the icons that are displayed on the &quot;<strong>System structure</strong>&quot; page. It is important to say that this button will be available at any time in the &quot;<strong>Status Bar</strong>&quot; so it will not be necessary to select items. Next, the icons corresponding to this page are shown:</p> <p><img src="/en/026.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="/en/027.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>The &quot;<strong>Info</strong>&quot; button shows the general information of the selected item, then an example is shown:</p> <p><img src="/en/028.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>It can be see one that presents the following information:</p> <ul><li><strong>Edges Out/In</strong>. It refers to the number of inputs and outputs that the element has, that is, the relationships with the rest of the System. &quot;<strong>In</strong>&quot; indicates the number of elements that are referenced by the selected element (<strong>From</strong>) and &quot;<strong>Out</strong>&quot; indicates the number of elements that refer to the selected element (<strong>To</strong>).</li> <li><strong>Description</strong>. Shows the descriptive text of the operation of the element.</li> <li><strong>Type</strong>. Qualifier to which the element belongs.</li> <li><strong>Attr</strong>. A qualifier is shown according to the type and language that the element is made.</li> <li><strong>Size (Bytes)</strong>. Measures in bytes the amount of space that the element occupies in memory.</li> <li><strong>Creation date</strong>. Shows the exact date and time the item was created.</li> <li><strong>Creation System</strong>. Displays the name of the AS400 server where the item was created.</li> <li><strong>Creator</strong>. Displays the name of the user who created the item.</li> <li><strong>Source lines</strong>. Total, of lines of code that were used to create the element.</li> <li><strong>Complexity</strong>. Cyclomatic complexity of the element.</li></ul> <p><img src="/en/029.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Pressing this button opens a tab in the browser where can see the entire structure of the element. An example is shown:</p> <p><img src="/en/030.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>By means of the button <img src="/en/ico/027.png" width="20" height="20"> that is available in the right part at the end of each tab, the information contained in each one is displayed. The first tab shows the general information of the element next to the corresponding metrics, an example is shown:</p> <p><img src="/en/031.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>In the &quot;<strong>Source code</strong>&quot; tab, all the source code of the element is detailed, while the following tabs are variable since the &quot;<strong>Source code</strong>&quot; is broken down by parts. Here is an example:</p> <p><img src="/en/032.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>The following tabs as mentioned above are fragments of the &quot;<strong>Source code</strong>&quot; where can see in three ways shown below:</p> <p><img src="/en/033.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>The <strong><em>Discovery View</em></strong> makes a translation of the code &quot;<strong>Legacy</strong>&quot; to &quot;<strong>Java Pseudocode</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>Flowchart</strong>&quot; with the intention of improving the interpretation of the element for a conversion process. This can be done with any element present in the System.</p> <p><img src="/en/034.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>This part of the &quot;<strong>Status bar</strong>&quot; shows the name (INVO_PB) next to the item identifier (26).</p> <p><img src="/en/035.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>The relationships that the element has with the other elements of the System are shown. &quot;<strong>Out</strong>&quot; Indicates the number of elements that refer to the selected element, they are also known as &quot;<strong>Dependencies</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>In</strong>&quot; Indicates the number of elements that are referenced by the selected element are also known as &quot;<strong>Precedencies</strong>&quot;.</p> <p><img src="/en/036.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>This part shows the amount of lines of code that have been used to create the element, followed by the cyclomatic complexity of the same.</p> <p><img src="/en/037.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>It refers to the number of lines of code that have been used to create the elements and the average complexity of the entire selection of elements.</p> <p><img src="/en/038.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>The number &quot;<strong>10</strong>&quot; refers to the number of elements selected, the next number &quot;<strong>104</strong>&quot; refers to the number of elements shown in the &quot;<strong>Display Panel</strong>&quot;, after which the number &quot;<strong>104</strong>&quot; is displayed, which refers to the quantity total of elements that make up the System and finally shows the number &quot;<strong>12</strong>&quot; enclosed in brackets &quot;<strong>[]</strong>&quot; that refers to the number of &quot;<strong>Clusters</strong>&quot; created in the System.</p> <p>A <strong>Clusters</strong> is mostly used in Systems of a certain dimension, since the high number of objects makes its use difficult. It is defined as a grouping of elements with the sole purpose of reducing the number of elements displayed, facilitating the visualization and manipulation of the System.</p> <p><img src="/en/039.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>When clicking on this button located on the right side of the &quot;<strong>Toolbar</strong>&quot; a panel called &quot;<strong>Selection Panel</strong>&quot; is displayed where the Groups, Tags, Use Cases will be seen, among other things that will be explained later. On the other hand, this button will be available at any time.</p> <h3 id="selection-panel"><a href="#selection-panel" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Selection Panel</h3> <p>It is a panel that as mentioned was hidden, pressing the button <img src="/en/ico/028.png" width="20" height="20"> located on the right side of the &quot;<strong>Status Bar</strong>&quot; is shown having the following appearance:</p> <p><img src="/en/040.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>This panel contains four sections called &quot;<strong>Current Selection</strong> <img src="/en/ico/029.png" width="20" height="20">&quot;, &quot;<strong>Groups</strong> <img src="/en/ico/030.png" width="20" height="20">&quot;, &quot;<strong>Tags</strong> <img src="/en/ico/031.png" width="20" height="20">&quot; and &quot;<strong>Use Cases</strong> <img src="/en/ico/032.png" width="20" height="20">&quot;. These sections will be explained below.</p> <h4 id="current-selection"><a href="#current-selection" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Current Selection</h4> <p>This section is similar to the one explained above on the &quot;<strong>Objects dictionary</strong>&quot; page, with the difference that it includes new features. One of these is the usability of &quot;<strong>Frontiers</strong>&quot;, the creation of &quot;<strong>Clusters</strong>&quot;, among others.</p> <p>Each of the functions that can be executed in this section will be explained in detail.</p> <h5 id="selected-item"><a href="#selected-item" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Selected item</h5> <p>To send elements to this section, it must be selected keeping the right mouse button and passing over the desired element (s), then once the elements have been selected, the icon <img src="/en/ico/033.png" width="20" height="20"> must be pressed. Here is an example:</p> <p><img src="/en/041.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>If it wants be to remove an item from the list, it has to click on the icon <img src="/en/ico/034.png" width="20" height="20"> located on the right side of its description. On the other hand, if it wants be to remove all the elements must be press the button <img src="/en/ico/035.png" width="20" height="20">.</p> <h5 id="create-groups-or-clusters"><a href="#create-groups-or-clusters" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Create Groups or Clusters</h5> <p>Once the elements have been selected, a group can be created where it could be in this case Group or Cluster. To do this, click on the icon <img src="/en/ico/036.png" width="20" height="20"> and a pop-up page appears that allows to enter the descriptive data of the icon. Here is an example:</p> <p><img src="/en/042.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>As can see in the lower part of the pop-up page there are two buttons that allow the creation of the group, to create a Group it must be click on the &quot;<strong>Save as Group</strong>&quot; button and to create a Cluster it must be press the button &quot;<strong>Save as Cluster</strong>&quot;.</p> <h5 id="download"><a href="#download" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Download</h5> <p>When clicking on this button an Excel file is downloaded with information of the elements selected in the section. This Excel file is the same as the one explained in the &quot;<strong>Objects dictionary</strong>&quot; page, for more information see in that section.</p> <h4 id="groups"><a href="#groups" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Groups</h4> <p>In this section a list is shown with all the groupings of the System, that is, Groups and Clusters. Through the different functions be can edit, download and compare. It will be explained below.</p> <h5 id="edit"><a href="#edit" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Edit</h5> <p>It can be deleting a Group or Cluster by clicking on the icon <img src="/en/ico/036.png" width="20" height="20"> on the right of the description of each one, it is important to say that the action will be direct. On the other hand, the modification of a group can be done by pressing the icon <img src="/en/ico/037.png" width="20" height="20"> that fulfills the function of transferring all the elements corresponding to the group to the &quot;<strong>Current selection</strong>&quot; section where elements can be added or removed, in the same way they can be changed the descriptive data of it.</p> <h5 id="download-and-upload"><a href="#download-and-upload" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Download and Upload</h5> <p>As in the &quot;<strong>Objects dictionary</strong>&quot; page, it can be downloading an Excel file with information on one or all of the groupings, for which the button is used <img src="/en/ico/038.png" width="20" height="20">. Likewise, once this file has been edited, it can be loaded into the System using the button <img src="/en/ico/039.png" width="20" height="20">. For more information, see the &quot;<strong>Objects dictionary</strong>&quot; page, where it talks more in detail about the upload process and the modifications that can be made.</p> <h5 id="buttons-select-or-and-and"><a href="#buttons-select-or-and-and" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Buttons Select, Or and And</h5> <p>These buttons are at the top of this section, each one fulfills a specific function that are explained below:</p> <h6 id="select"><a href="#select" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Select</h6> <p>By default, this button is activated and fulfills the function of showing the elements of a specific Group in the &quot;<strong>Display Panel</strong>&quot;. If the elements of the Group are together with other elements not belonging to the Group, those elements corresponding to the Group will be highlighted according to the defined color, while the rest will be displayed in the background. Here is an example:</p> <p><img src="/en/043.jpg" alt=""></p> <h6 id="or"><a href="#or" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Or</h6> <p>Unlike the &quot;<strong>Select</strong>&quot; button, selecting this button allows to choose more than one grouping, highlighting the elements of the groupings according to the defined color. Here is an example:</p> <p><img src="/en/044.jpg" alt=""></p> <h6 id="and"><a href="#and" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> And</h6> <p>Finally, this button fulfills the function of highlighting only the elements that have in common the selection of Groups, when there are no elements in common all the elements are shown in the background. Here is an example:</p> <p><img src="/en/045.jpg" alt=""></p> <h4 id="tags"><a href="#tags" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Tags</h4> <p>Tags are marks that are put on an element in order to differentiate the different actions of the same, an element can be associated with several Tags. The Tagging does not affect the functioning of the System since as mentioned before it is a distinctive mark.</p> <p>The process to create a Tag is done from the &quot;<strong>Save selection</strong>&quot; pop-up page of the Groups creation, where there is a field that allows to put a Tag. If the Tag already exists it will be updated by associating the new elements, while if it does not exist it will be created at the moment. In this section it can be see the list of Tags created in the System, it can be also performed functions that will be explained below.</p> <h5 id="download-2"><a href="#download-2" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Download</h5> <p>It can be downloaded through the button <img src="/en/ico/040.png" width="20" height="20"> functionality that once clicked automatically downloads a file in Excel format that contains information of the Tags created in the System. As in the &quot;<strong>Groups</strong>&quot; section, be can download the information of a specific tag so it must be pressing the button <img src="/en/ico/041.png" width="20" height="20"> that is located on the right side of the description of the same. Here is an example:</p> <p><img src="/en/046.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>As it can be see when downloading the information of all the Tags, different tabs with the name of each one that contains the information of the elements that are associated to it are shown in the document. The headings in this table refer to the following:</p> <ul><li><strong>Oid</strong>. It is the code used to identify the element in the System, there will not be two elements with the same code.</li> <li><strong>Library</strong>. Shows the name of the library to which the element belongs.</li> <li><strong>Name</strong>. Refers to the name of the element.</li> <li><strong>Title</strong>. It is a descriptive text that refers to the functionality of the element.</li> <li><strong>Type</strong>. Qualification of the element (file or program).</li> <li><strong>Attr</strong>. Depending on the type and programming language, an attribute is assigned.</li></ul> <h5 id="statistics"><a href="#statistics" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Statistics</h5> <p>The statistics of a Tag is based on the number of times the commands containing the elements in the System have been executed.
