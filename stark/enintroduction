<h1>Introduction</h1>

This document describes the functionality of the ***Discovery View***, which is part of the **Caravel Insight** tool, and its use.

The ***Discovery View*** shows the physical and logical structure of a System; highlighting the relationships between the elements that make it up (programs, files and others). It shows a complete information of each element with its characteristics and functionalities.

It offers a graphic and overall vision, to facilitate an intuitive knowledge of the System and its general structure. With functionalities that allow subdividing, grouping and isolating parts of it.

A series of specialized tools help the visualization and extraction of the logic of each of its elements, allowing an understanding of the operation as a whole.

The tool is organized in different pages. In each of them, various tools are included to navigate and use the different functionalities. Depending on the type of item analyzed, the controls vary autonomously.

On each page, different menus with multiple options are available. The information in the legends identifies, according to each function, the types of elements and relationships.

In the face of a conversion process, where it is essential to know, analyze, understand and delimit each component of the System, the ***Discovery View*** offers everything necessary to maximize the potential of conversion and reduce the margin of error.

The ***Discovery View*** not only allows analyzing the elements and characteristics that the System has for a conversion process, but also allows simulating the reaction that has when migrating a module, as well as the implementation of new elements or modules at the same.

This manual corresponds to version 7.4.4 of ***Discovery View***.
