 <h1>Use Cases</h1>

It is defined as "**Use Cases**" to a succession of actions within the System that constitute a process to fulfill a function. It is a mechanism that allows reproducing the behavior of the System and analyzing its functionality. Corresponds to the operations performed by the users of the System in their work with it. **_Discovery View_** allows to manage the "**Use Cases**" that are previously generated by the "**_Caravel Test Maker_**" tool.

**_Discovery View_** allows the analysis of all the "**Use Cases**" recorded in the System. It can be seen in different levels of details, thus achieving a better understanding of them. Next, the start corresponding to this page is shown:

As it can be see in the beginning of this page, a list with all the "**Use Cases**" of the System is displayed in an orderly manner. To begin with the analysis, click on the icon <img src="/en/ico/003.png" width="20" height="20"> that is located on the right side of the description of each "**Use Case**". Next, it shows:

In this first part of the analysis a summary of the sequence diagram is shown, where the different interactions that exist between the elements that make up this "**Use Case**" are reflected. To see in detail, it must be pressing the "**Show details**" button as shown in the previous image. Here is an example:

By pressing the "**Show Steps**" button as shown in the red box of the previous image, it can be access a maximum level of detail, showing the step by step of the route carried out by the "**Use Case**" where the screens are also reflected which the user visualizes. Here is an example:

![](/en/118.jpg)

As it can be see, each step is composed of a "**User input**" that refers to the input of data by the user and a "**Sequence diagram**" that refers to the corresponding sequence diagram in that fragment of the "**Use Case**". Next, the "**User input**" is displayed:

Next, the sequence diagram corresponding to this step is shown:

This can be done with each "**Use Cases**" in the System, the level of depth in the analysis is taken to the highest level of detail so that it can be get a better understanding of each of these.
